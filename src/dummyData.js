The application black hole, where resumes seem to disappear without a trace, is a common challenge. To shine through this darkness, candidates can tailor their resumes and cover letters to each job application. Highlighting specific achievements, skills, and experiences relevant to the position can catch the recruiter's eye. Additionally, leveraging professional networks, such as LinkedIn, and reaching out directly to hiring managers can help candidates bypass the application black hole. Skilltera (https://www.skilltera.com) is trying to address this in a unique way by showing percentage matching upfront so that candidates can know the possibility of getting recruiter’s attention. Percentage matching is determined by matching several of the candidate’s and job-specific parameters such as skill and their ratings, experience, recommendations, and skill ratings received from recommender, etc.",
